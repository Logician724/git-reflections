when would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all  your work local?

1- when you want to keep the versions of your source code on a cloud server
2- when you want to collaborate with different people so that you can push your local data
    to the cloud and other people can pull this data back into their local machine and vice versa.
    

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote
repository?

In order to be able to only pull changes that make up a new feature or something new in the source code instead of just
pulling source code that doesn't work or conflicts with the code you are working on.
