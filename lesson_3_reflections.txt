when would you want to create a remote repository rather than 
keeping all  your work local?

1- when you want to keep the versions of your source code on a 
cloud server
2- when you want to collaborate with different people so that 
you can push your local data to the cloud and other people can 
pull this data back into their local machine and vice versa.
    

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than 
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote
repository?

In order to be able to only pull changes that make up a new 
feature or something new in the source code instead of just
pulling source code that doesn't work or conflicts with the 
code you are working on.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another?

forks: copy a version of a repository on github to your own
github account, but nothing gets copied to your local machine.

clones: copy a remote repository on github to your local 
machine 

branches: make a different version of the code on your local 
machine with the same parent commit, in order to work on new feature or expirement on some code.
