What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
when you initialize a repository a hidden directory (.git) is added to the current directory (where you called git init).
No commits are added to the repository initailly though, and you have to make a commit yourself after repo initialization

You need repos in order to have a workspace for your version control environment.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

the staging area is where you add files to be added in order to make a commit, which is different from the repository which
acts as a directory for your project files etc.
